var x = 5;
var y = 3;
var z = 2;

// alert (x / y);  <= equals 1
//alert (x % y);   <= equals 0.


//example with the modulus operator % - fx if you page have many paragraphs and can be used well with the "if" statement when you want target every 3 item/row and make changes to them only.


//using the += operator

z += 2; // is the same as z = z + 2;

/* try using some of the other operators to do math :)
 fx this one:
 var h = 3;
 ++h;  // is the same as h = 3 + 1; in this case. Where could this be used to great effect?
*/

// alert(z);


// Relational operator test. == (is it the same?)
//alert(x !== y);


//Using conditional statements  (only do a alertbox IF x is greater then y
//if(x > y)
//    alert("test");

// Conditional + CONJUNCTION
//      1    1      1     <= look at our table with expr and results
// if(x > y && y == 3)
// alert("test");



//DISJUNCTION
//      0    1      1     <= Check the disjunction table. Try to remove the alert box by changing our code.
// if(x < y || y == 3)
//    alert("test");
