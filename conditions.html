    <h3>HINT - always use curly brackets{ } in statements. Learn to love them :) </h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript Conditions - they can be used when you fx want to validate your form in HTML.
    </p>
    <h4>Conditional statements:</h4>

    <p>
        When using the " if " statement, you are checking if something is true or false.
    <blockquote>
              <pre>
                <xmp>
                   if(5 > 3)
                        alert("Unlimited poowwwaahhh!!!");
                </xmp>
              </pre>
    </blockquote>
    That actually is read as:   if(1)    since the statement is true and true = 1, and false = 0.
    If it is true, then the next line of code is gonna be executed. So the example when have a popup alert box with text.
    </p>

    <p>
        Example with shortened conditional statement can be found in the conditional.js file. Quicker way to write a true or false statement. You can do what you feel like, one is not more correct then the other.
    </p>

    <h4>Switch</h4>
    <p>When using the Switch conditional statement, always remember to put in a "break;" as shown in the code. or it just go through all cases.<br>
    It is not the most used statement, but it can make the code easier to read - especially for people new to JavaScript.
