    <p>Why bother with using a Variable when we can just type the actual number in a calculator fx.</p>
    <p>Lets imagine that we want to calculate taxes with different values - like Value Added Tax (VAT) when you shop online(outside DK).</p>

    Assignment for JavaScript Variable
        <ul>
            <li>By using Variables in a similar as with the VAT example: Create a dynamic variable with cars, prices, and amount and calculate a combined cost of buying more then one car </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>ex: var carBMW = 399999; var carMerc = 449999; var carLada = 99; and so on</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Create a variable that holds amounts of bought cars and by using variables</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>now create a Variable that calculates the price of buying a car + the amount by only using Variables that you created </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Show the calculation by using the alert();</li>
            <li>Now you want to buy the same amount of cars, but another maker/model and add the total cost of these to the previous calculated price</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>ie: var buy = carModel1 * amount + carModel2 * amount; </li>
                    <li>Looking at the previous variable - how can it be changed to something like: var buy = carBuy1 + carBuy2</li>
                    <li>do and alert to test</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Create 3 variables with 3 different colors now. Ie var carColor1 = "red"; (when not using numbers you need to add " " around the text so javascript know it is a text it needs to show. </li>
            <li>Now we need to add all to the alert</li>
            <li>We want the alert to show the following::: <b>You have bought = 6 cars in the color = blue and the total cost is = 1650000 DKK</b> (you price, color and amount may variate depending on what you declare in your variable </li>
            <li>Now change the numbers so you get 12 cars, all in blue, and a new total price</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NB! Remember to have the variables that are used later at the top of the javascript file. if you want to use <i>var amount</i> it needs to be set before you are using in it <i>var totalAmount = amount + amount</i>. Very important</p>
        <p>the solution (or one solution to the last task) can be found in the javascript file called "variables.js". Do try before looking at the solution
