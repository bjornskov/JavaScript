    <h4>Functions:</h4>
    <a>
        JavaScript Functions. Function is simply a block of code which can be invoked(executed) at any given time, and as many times as needed and in different places in our code. Even other people can use them.
        <br>Sometimes functions are sometimes called "methods".
        <br>Our alertbox that have been used alot, is a function in JavaScript.
        <br>jQuery is a JavaScript library, which is free to use for everybody. It holds so many useful functions we can use to make awesome things on our webpage/applications. Check it out at some point at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jquery.com">www.jquery.com</a>.
    </p>
        <p>Function are used to create many different scripts that only needs to get executed at a specific event, click, load and so on. Also so we only have the code once and can reuse it.
    </p>

    <h4>Scope of Variables</h4>
        <p>Scope of variables within the script/functions. Score (range) means where the variable is available</p>


    <h4>Quick recap</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Global variable can be accessed anywhere in your script</li>
            <li>A local variable created inside the function is hidden from other functions and other scripting code. When you create a local and a global variable with the same name you can access/change both and they wont interfere with eachother</li>
            <li>Local variable is deleted after the function returns the value freeing up memory</li>
            <li>Variables created without the keyword "var" are always global even if the are created inside a function. So be careful because assigning value to the variable that was not yet declared is creating a new global variable</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Anonymous functions or Function expressions</h4>
        <p>Functions as an expressions (as the value of the variable)</p>
